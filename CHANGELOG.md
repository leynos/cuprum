# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking changes

- **`ExecHook` import path (breaking):** Import `ExecHook` from top-level
  `cuprum` or its definition site, `cuprum.events`. The former
  `cuprum.context.ExecHook` re-export has been removed; only the import path
  changes, not the hook signature or registration behaviour.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-21

### Changed

- **Environment overlays (breaking):** Document that scoped `env(...)` overlays
  resolve against the live `os.environ` at subprocess spawn time, so callers
  that depended on an import-time or scope-entry snapshot must pass explicit
  values through the overlay or `ExecutionContext.env` instead
