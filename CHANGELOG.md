# Changelog

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-21

### Changed

- **Environment overlays (breaking):** Document that scoped `env(...)` overlays
  resolve against the live `os.environ` at subprocess spawn time, so callers
  that depended on an import-time or scope-entry snapshot must pass explicit
  values through the overlay or `ExecutionContext.env` instead
  ([#175](https://github.com/leynos/cuprum/pull/175), [d2e2b92](https://github.com/leynos/cuprum/commit/d2e2b921bde69b8162ba0ca37ed68d36c5d6c8a6)).
