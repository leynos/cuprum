class RunOutputOptions:
    """Configure captured and mirrored command output.

    Parameters
    ----------
    capture : bool, default=True
        Store stdout and stderr on the returned result. Capture is independent
        of echoing, so a captured stream can remain silent and an echoed stream
        can be left uncaptured.
    echo : bool, default=False
        Shorthand for enabling both ``echo_stdout`` and ``echo_stderr`` unless
        either stream has an explicit override.
    echo_stdout : bool | None, default=None
        Whether stdout is mirrored to the execution context's stdout sink.
        ``None`` inherits ``echo``.
    echo_stderr : bool | None, default=None
        Whether stderr is mirrored to the execution context's stderr sink.
        ``None`` inherits ``echo``.
    max_echo_line_bytes : int | None, default=64 * 1024
        Inclusive byte bound for every echoed line, including its retained
        bytes, truncation marker, and terminator. ``None`` restores unbounded,
        chunk-for-chunk mirroring; captured output always remains complete.
    on_line : LineHook | None, default=None
        Optional synchronous callback invoked once per decoded output line
        with a ``LineEvent`` carrying the stream name, the monotonic seconds
        since the command started, and the line text. Independent of
        ``capture`` and ``echo``; lines are delivered in arrival order per
        stream. Lines are observed on the Python pathway, so the Rust
        fast-path dispatcher stays out of the way whenever this is set.
    idle_after : float | None, default=None
        Seconds of silence, measured across both streams, before the run
        reports that it is still running. ``None`` disables idle reporting and
        costs nothing: no watchdog, no timer, no extra pipe. The interval must
        be finite and strictly positive. Reporting describes the absence of
        observed output — never a deadlock diagnosis — and can neither
        terminate the child nor extend its timeout.
    on_idle : cabc.Callable[[float, float], None] | None, default=None
        Synchronous ``(elapsed_total, elapsed_idle)`` callback, in seconds,
        invoked once per idle interval in place of the built-in stderr
        keepalive. It must not block for long: it runs on the run's own event
        loop. Requires ``idle_after``.
    sink : sinks.OutputSink | None, default=None
        Optional presentation adapter (:mod:`cuprum.sinks` protocol). When
        given, it may reframe the parent-facing output of this run (for
        example, a GitHub Actions group); the default ``None`` keeps the
        plain two-stream behaviour. An adapter is inactive for a run when it
        declines activation, in which case output is unchanged.
    group : bool, default=False
        Convenience opt-in for a GitHub Actions collapsible log group around
        this run's echoed output. It is a shim over ``sink``: setting it
        constructs ``GitHubActionsSink(emit_group=True)`` and stores it in
        ``sink`` when the caller supplied none, so the framing, the
        stop-commands lease that shields it from child output, and the
        workflow-command syntax all stay inside the adapter and the execution
        layer learns nothing new. A pipeline emits one group for the whole
        pipeline, not one per stage. Values other than ``bool`` raise
        ``ValueError``.
    annotate_failure : bool, default=False
        Convenience opt-in for a single ``::error::`` annotation when the run
        ends in a non-zero exit, a timeout, or an error. Synthesizes
        ``GitHubActionsSink(emit_annotation=True)`` the same way ``group`` does,
        and composes with it: either flag alone synthesizes the adapter with
        only its own half enabled. Values other than ``bool`` raise
        ``ValueError``.

    Notes
    -----
    The two convenience flags reuse the same environment gate as any other
    sink: the adapter they construct carries no ``force``, so they take effect
    only when the parent process runs on GitHub Actions
    (``GITHUB_ACTIONS == "true"``). Outside that environment they synthesize a
    sink that declines activation and the run keeps its plain destinations
    byte-for-byte — which is the intended behaviour, not a failure to apply
    them. Callers who want the framing locally, on a non-standard runner, or
    through a custom destination or title pass ``sink=`` explicitly, possibly
    with ``force=True``.

    An explicit ``sink`` always wins: when one is supplied the flags are
    recorded but ignored, and no adapter is synthesized. Put the sink on a
    new ``RunOutputOptions`` or use ``dataclasses.replace`` when adapting
    shared options; ``run`` methods do not override ``output.sink`` per call.
    Passing a sink obtained from another options object to a new
    ``RunOutputOptions(sink=...)`` also makes it explicit, even when the sink
    was originally synthesized by the convenience flags.
    Replacing either flag on flag-generated options rebuilds their adapter to
    match the new values, while an explicitly supplied sink remains untouched.

    The default GitHub Actions sink does not serialize overlapping sessions.
    Do not run grouped commands concurrently when they write to the same parent
    stderr; run them sequentially so their workflow frames cannot interleave.

    Workflow commands are written to the parent's stderr by default. Neither
    flag changes capture, exit codes, or the returned result.
